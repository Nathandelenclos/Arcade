The Arcade project was a team effort to develop Pacman and Snake games as shared libraries in C++ using OOP, with the flexibility to run with SFML, SDL, and Ncurses display libraries. It involved designing code architecture, implementing game functionality, creating interfaces, and integrating external libraries to hone programming skills.

## About
<div id="about"></div>
The Arcade project was a collaborative effort undertaken as part of a programming course. The objective was to develop two classic games, Pacman and Snake, in the form of shared libraries (.so) using object-oriented programming (OOP) in the C++ language. These games were designed to be executable with three other shared libraries implementing the SFML, SDL, and Ncurses libraries, providing flexibility in the choice of display library for the user.

The development of the project involved several key stages, including the design of the code architecture, implementation of basic game functionality, creation of user interfaces for each graphics library, and integration of external rendering libraries to allow users to choose their preferred display library.

The SFML library was used to provide a high-quality 2D graphical interface, SDL to allow direct manipulation of user input and output, and Ncurses to offer a console-like interface for users who prefer a command-line experience.

Overall, the Arcade project was a rewarding exercise for team members who had the opportunity to work on important programming skills such as OOP, user interface management, and integration of third-party libraries.
